    <h2>Have Any Questions?</h2></div>
<h3>How will waste be collected, recycled and processed on board and ashore?</h3>

<p>Waste will be brought aboard the Sedna via the collection mats located between the hulls, via the trawls installed at the stern of the boat, or via the Mobula, our small multi-service waste collection boats. Waste will then be sorted manually. Organic waste that is not soiled with plastic particles will be thrown back into the water. Most of the remaining plastic waste will be recovered on board and converted into electricity to power the propulsion and operation of the boat. Part of the non-recoverable waste will be stored in order to be unloaded in the ports to be taken care of by local treatment and recycling channels.</p>

<h3>What will you do with the collected plastic?</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to bring as little plastic as possible ashore. And in this case, it will only be because we are sure that adequate recycling facilities exist and that they can process the plastic we bring back. Most, if not all, of the plastic collected at sea will be converted into electricity through our waste-to-energy unit.</li>

<li> that is not treated and converted to energy on board will be stored in big bags on board before being offloaded in the port for delivery to local recycling industry partners where possible, or to The SeaCleaners’ international partners.</li>

<li> philosophy of The SeaCleaners is to contribute to the development of the circular economy and recycling industries in the countries where the Manta will operate. We will therefore work with local recycling stakeholders in each country to identify the best partners. To this end, we are already in contact with local authorities and associations in the initial areas of intervention.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Will you only collect and sort plastic waste? What will you do with other waste (bottles, toys, sports shoes, towels, other packaging)?</h3>

<p>Waste will be sorted manually after the collection phase. What will not be converted into energy will be stored to be brought back to the shore and re-injected into local recycling routes. Our waste storage capacity is just over 50 tons (140 cubic meters). In addition to this, we will have a 33 m3 container for nets and a 33 m3 container for hazardous waste, for a total of 206 m3 of storage.</p>

<h3> The Sedna project profitable?</h3>

<p>As a public interest association, The sedna is a non-profit organization. The sedna is developed to contribute to the common good. The problem of ocean plastic pollution can be compared to the collection of waste in municipalities. Is waste removal profitable? No, it is a public service. But it is necessary if we do not want to live in streets littered with garbage and to avoid public health problems.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that, when designing the sedna, every effort is made to use the financial donations of our supporters in the most efficient way possible.</p>
